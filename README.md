# Machine-learning-classification-clustering-pipeline
End-to-end machine learning pipeline implementing supervised classification and unsupervised clustering with preprocessing, PCA, and model evaluation.
Machine Learning Pipeline for Classification and Clustering

The project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, classification modeling, clustering, and performance evaluation within a single Jupyter Notebook implementation.

Project Objectives
 Build a complete ML pipeline from raw data to evaluation
 Compare supervised classification algorithms
 Discover hidden structure using clustering
 Apply dimensionality reduction using PCA
 Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

Machine Learning Methods
Supervised Learning
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Logistic Regression

Unsupervised Learning
KMeans Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Results
Classification accuracy ≈ 92–93%
Feature scaling significantly improved model performance
Hierarchical clustering produced strongest cluster separation
